/**
 * Plugin Name: GeduShop Combo Sets
 * Description: Sell several products together at one price, with the combo's stock derived from the products inside it rather than kept as a second number.
 * Version:     1.0.0
 * Author:      GeduShop
 * Requires PHP: 7.4
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ONE RULE
 *
 * A combo never holds its own stock. Its `_stock` is written, but only ever by
 * this plugin, and always as a figure computed from its components:
 *
 *     buildable = min over components of floor( component stock / qty per set )
 *
 * That is what makes the same piece sellable twice — once on its own, once
 * inside every combo containing it — without two counts that drift apart. Sell
 * the last aeroplane on its own and every combo containing one goes to zero;
 * sell that combo and the aeroplane's own listing goes to zero.
 *
 * Why the figure is STORED rather than filtered on read: the storefront asks
 * the Store API for `?stock_status=instock`, and that is a postmeta query, not
 * a runtime filter. A combo whose components had run out would keep turning up
 * in listings — filtered out one page at a time and counted in none of the
 * totals. So the number is kept true by writing it, not by intercepting reads.
 *
 * Nothing here is the source of truth for the business. GeduSuite holds that,
 * derives its own stock the same way from its own purchase and sale records,
 * and never reads these numbers. This side exists so the shop cannot sell what
 * the shelf cannot supply.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *
 * Repeats are real and expected. The shop that pushes these recipes tracks a

 * "Red x1, Blue x2" arrives as that listing, twice. It merges to x3 before
 * anything counts it, because the arithmetic downstream takes the smallest
 * stock/qty across the rows: left as two rows, ten in stock answers
 * min(10/1, 10/2) = 5 sets when only 3 can be packed, and the shop would sell
 * the difference. Hand-written recipes in the box below can repeat a product
